				<strong>Mark Norell answers kids' questions about dinosaurs. He’s a paleontologist
				at the American Museum of Natural History.</strong>
			</p>
			<h3>
				<em> 1. What's the biggest dinosaur you've ever found?</em>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Mark Norell: The biggest fossil dinosaurs I've ever found are sauropods
					 from Central Asia as well as from the American West. These animals are related
					  to the Apatosaurus and Mamenchisaurus. Mamenchisaurus is a giant sauropod from 
					  Central Asia. These plant-eating animals had fantastically huge, long necks and were 
					  the heaviest and longest dinosaurs ever found. Sauropods were the biggest animals ever
					   to walk Earth .
			</p>
			<h3>
				<em> 2. What's the weirdest dinosaur you've ever found?</em>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Mark: The weirdest fossil dinosaur I've ever found had to be Shuvuuia, 
					a relative of Mononykus. It's weird because no one would ever have imagined
					 an animal that looked like that would have ever lived. It had really powerful, 
					 but extremely short forelimbs. These theropod dinosaurs had bodies about the size 
					 of a goose, but with long legs. Shuvuuia and Mononykus were both discovered in Mongolia ,
					  and had feathers. They were both birds, but they really didn't look like them.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<em> 3. What's the most interesting dinosaur fossil you've ever found?</em>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Mark: Probably the most interesting dinosaur fossil I ever found is the nesting Oviraptor. 
				This fossil really tells us something special about the past: that these animals looked and 
				behaved like birds. The specimen found where the adult Oviraptor is positioned on a nest of
				 eggs is compelling evidence that these animals behaved like parents in a very bird-like way. 
				 This behavior, coupled with such birdlike characteristics as a toothless beak and possibly feathers,
				  strengthens the bird-dinosaur connections even more.

				<em> 4. How long does it take for bones to become fossilized?</em>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Mark: Not all fossil bones are alike. Some fossil bones that are 60 or 70 million years 
				old have a lot of their original chemical composition. They almost seem more like bone than 
				rock. Other fossil bones could be "just" 10,000 years old, but they're so hard you could drive
				 nails with them. How long it takes depends on the conditions the bone is buried in. Here's a tip.
				  When you find a fossil bone, you already know something about the animal. You know it must have
				   been buried very quickly. Why? Bones left exposed for long would decay. After an animal is buried, the specific conditions of the local environment come into play.
